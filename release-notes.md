**Android Griffon 1.1.0**

* The Griffon bridge and the Griffon SDK are now unified.

  The set up steps are now slightly different. For more information, see [Set up Project Griffon](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/beta/project-griffon/set-up-project-griffon).

The Project Griffon web UI now has new views specifically for users who are trying to inspect and improve Adobe Analytics and Location Service \(Places\) implementations.

**Adobe Analytics View**

The new Adobe Analytics view shows you events that are only related to your Adobe Analytics implementation. The list view now displays the action/state name and event, `status`, with a newly formatted detail view. `status` tells you when an SDK event is generated \(processed\), whether the SDK has made a network request with Adobe Analytics \(queued\), and whether post-processing information about the event \(validated\) is returned. This information helps you determine whether your context data is being appropriately mapped in Adobe Analytics.

The detailed view for an Analytics track event contains the following parts:

* The originating SDK Analytics request event.
* The OOTB meta and context data from the request, such as the report suite ID, the SDK extension versions, the OOTB context data, and so on.
* The post-processed information on the Analytics event, which contains mapping of revars, evars, props, and so on.

For more information, see [Adobe Analytics and Project Griffon](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/beta/project-griffon/using-project-griffon/adobe-analytics-and-project-griffon).

**Location Service \(Places\) View**

The new Location Services views allow you to inspect location entry and exit events on the Project Griffon web UI and on a mobile device. Depending on your business workflows, these views provide a convenient interface to view location-specific data points for inspection on the web/client for in-context debugging.

For more information, see [Location Service and Project Griffon](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/beta/project-griffon/using-project-griffon/location-service-and-project-griffon).

The January 24th update includes changes to the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs and solution extensions for iOS applications. We provided an explanation of this change, why the changes were made, and how to update your application to include these changes.

### What

With this release, we have changed the Mobile SDK Core and all Adobe solution extensions from dynamic frameworks to static libraries.

### Why

Frameworks are an excellent way to package and distribute iOS dependencies but, in some situations, using frameworks can cause issues when a dependent framework is updated. All of the Adobe Experience Platform SDK extensions have a dependency on the Core extension. This means that when a change is made to the Mobile Core framework, all dependent extensions need to be rebuilt from the source. To resolve this issue, we changed the SDK Core and all Adobe solution extensions to use static libraries.

### How

There is nothing wrong or broken with the previous versions of the SDK. Apps that have already started development with the version 1.x SDK and extensions can continue in the development lifecycle with no impact. Mobile applications that have not yet started to implement the Mobile SDKs are also fine, as they will start out using the static libraries. The changes listed below are required for customers who have started implementing the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK and want to update to the latest version.

{% hint style="info" %}
The changes are only for iOS.
{% endhint %}

To update existing Experience Platform Mobile SDK 1.x implementations to 2.x:

1. Use the latest installation instructions for your selected environment \(development, staging, production\).
2. Update your Pod file with the latest changes.
3. Run a 'pod update' command to pull in the latest version of the Mobile Core extension and any other solution extension updates.
4. In your app code, change all of your import statements:  

**For Objective-C**

Where you previously had imports that look like the following:

```text
   #import <ACPCore_iOS/ACPCore_iOS.h>
   #import <ACPIdentity_iOS/ACPIdentity_iOS.h>
   #import <ACPLifecycle_iOS/ACPLifecycle_iOS.h>
   #import <ACPSignal_iOS/ACPSignal_iOS.h>
   #import <ACPUserProfile_iOS/ACPUserProfile_iOS.h>
```

The imports will now drop the _iOS_ suffix and can be imported directly as follows:

```text
   #import "ACPCore.h"
   #import "ACPIdentity.h"
   #import "ACPLifecycle.h"
   #import "ACPSignal.h"
   #import "ACPUserProfile.h"
```

This change will hold true for any other Adobe solution extensions that you may have previously imported.

**For Swift**

Where you previously had imports that looked like:

```swift
   import ACPCore_iOS
   import ACPAnalytics_iOS
   import ACPIdentity_iOS
   import ACPLifecycle_iOS
   import ACPSignal_iOS
   import ACPUserProfile_iOS
```

The imports will now drop the _iOS_ suffix. Additionally, the Identity, Lifecycle and Signals extensions can be added just by importing core , for example:

```swift
    import ACPCore
    import ACPAnalytics
    import ACPUserProfile
```

We feel that this update will serve our customers and partners better in the long run. If you have any questions or issues, go to our [user forum](https://forums.adobe.com/community/experience-cloud/platform/launch/sdk#).

The **Adobe Campaign Classic** extension version 1.0.0 is now available for iOS!

This extension enables the delivery and tracking of push notifications to mobile app users from Adobe Campaign Classic.

{% hint style="info" %}
This extension is only for Adobe Campaign Classic and will not work with Adobe Campaign Standard.
{% endhint %}

#### Key Features

In this release, you can:

* Send push tokens with information about the user and the device to Adobe Campaign Classic so that users can enable push messaging to mobile app users who opt in to notifications.
* Send additional custom profile data to Adobe Campaign Classic, which allows personalized push notifications.
* Track the receipt of push messages \(impressions\) in Android apps and silent notifications in iOS apps.
* Track when users click on push notifications.
